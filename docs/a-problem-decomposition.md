Materials: Ball, Cones – 2 per team, Armbands (or anything to mark 2 teams) – for half of the players

No. of Players: 6 or more
:::

1. Form 2 teams. (Give armbands to one team.) 
2. How to play football without a goalie. Before they play, each team will discuss a strategy.
3. Ask: What do you need to think about to create your strategy?
4. Give teams a few minutes to create a strategy with the different actions that they need to take to reach their goal.
5. Begin the game.
6. Invite all the Scouts to take their second and third looks at the structure together.

  * What is not working?
  * What are the different actions that you need to take to reach your goal?

::: warning Questions
What were the different actions in your strategy?

hen you played, did you discover any important actions that were not in your strategy?

The different actions in your strategy were supposed to help you reach your goal. We can break big goals into smaller actions. What are some other games where teams need to break their goal into smaller actions?

Why is it helpful to break a large problem (such as a goal) into smaller parts?

## 8. Capture the Flag

To break a large problem into smaller parts.

::: warning Rules
Goal: To capture the other team’s flag and cross the centre line before being tagged.

Materials: Flags – 2, Chalk, rope or sticks (anything to mark the centre line and 2 Home Bases), Armbands or team marker – 1 each for half the players

No. of Players: 6 or more
:::

1. Mark the boundaries of the play area. Mark a centre line and 2 Home Bases at opposite ends of the play area.
2. Divide the players into 2 equal teams: Team A and Team B.
3. Give an armband to every player on Team A.
4. Give a flag to each team.
5. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * Each team will hide its flag in its own zone.
  * The goal of the game is to find the other team’s flag and bring it to your own zone.
  * Each team will protect its flag and try to find the other team’s flag.
  * When a player from Team A crosses into Team B’s Zone, the players from Team B can try to tag them. 
  * If tagged, the player from Team A goes to Team B’s Home Base. To be freed from Home Base, an untagged player from Team A must go to the Home Base and tag their teammate.
  * Teams and players can decide which team members want to cross into the other team’s zone. Players do not have to cross. They can stay on their own side to guard their flag.
  * If a player finds the flag of the other team, the player must take that flag across the centre line back to their side. However, if the player is tagged before crossing the line, they must give up the flag so that it can be returned to its original hiding place. The tagged player then must go to the other team’s Home Base.
6. Ask each team to take 3 minutes to hide its flag. Explain that teams cannot cover the flag completely. Part of the flag must be showing at all times.
7. Give each team 3 minutes to create a strategy to find the other team’s flag and protect their own.
8. Ask Team A to line up on one side of the centre line and Team B on the other side.
9. Begin the game.
10. After 5-8 minutes, pause the game. Ask each team to meet again to improve their strategy by thinking about these questions:
  * What is working in your strategy?
  * What is not working?
  * What are the different actions that you need to take to reach your goal?

::: warning Rules
What did your team talk about when you created your strategy?

How did you work together to put the strategy into action?

When you played, did you discover any important actions that were not in your strategy?

## 9. Brick by Brick

To break smaller parts into even smaller parts.

::: warning Rules
Goal: To get materials to build a tower.

Materials: Building material: Scrap paper, cards or anything to build a tower, Tape, Flipchart paper, Markers,Timer or timepiece

No. of Players: 6 or more
:::

1. Divide players into teams of 3-6 (make sure each team has a strong writer who can write for the team).
2. Invite each team to choose a school or community project that they want to practice breaking into smaller parts. 
3. Explain that after we break a large problem into smaller parts, we can also divide these smaller parts.
  * We can break each of these parts into smaller parts. For example, what do we need to do to teach peers about keeping the play area clean?
  * We can also break these into smaller parts. For example, what do we need to do to lead games?
4. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * When you say “Go!” each team will break their project into as many smaller parts as they can.
  * They should put all the smaller parts on paper
  * If they cannot think of ideas, they can ask themselves, “What do we need to do to...?” 
5. Give markers and flipchart paper to each team.
6. At the end of 3 minutes, invite teams to count their ideas.
7. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * Each team will try to build a strong tower that can stand by itself.
  * You will give building materials to each team based on the number of ideas they had. For example, if they had 10 ideas, they can have 10 pieces of paper.
  * Each team will also have 1 metre of tape. They need to think of a way to use the materials to make a tower that can stand (for example, put two sheets of paper together to make it thicker, fold the paper, etc.).
  * Before they begin building, they will have 5 minutes to add ideas to their mind map to earn more paper.
  * At the end of the game, you will see which tower is the most creative.
8. Invite teams to present their towers to the group.

::: warning Questions
Did you know you could break the tasks of your project into so many levels?

How is doing a large project similar to building a tower?

Why is it helpful to break a goal or problem into different parts, and then to break these parts into smaller parts?
