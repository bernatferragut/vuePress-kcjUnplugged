# ALGORITHMS

> A set of steps is called an algorithm. The steps need to be clear, specific and in the correct order. When we make algorithms, some common instructions (commands) we can use are:

1. Loops: A loop is an instruction that tells the computer to repeat a set of steps. For example, “Print the name of every child on the list” instead of “Print the first child’s name. Print the second child’s name.”

2. Conditionals: An algorithm needs to give instructions for every possible situation. For example, if the algorithm only says to direct the cars to the left and the bikes to the right, the person or computer following the instructions will not know what to do when a motorcycle arrives.

## 1. Team Trust

To give clear and specific instructions; to know that computers depend on clear and specific instructions.

::: warning Rules
Goal: To instruct your partner to safely pass through an obstacle course.

Materials: Blindfolds (or players can close their eyes), Random objects Chalk 

No. of Players: 2 or more
:::

> How do you think a computer knows how to do a task? - Computer programs have clear instructions.


### How to Play

1. Mark a rectangular play area. Mark a start line on one side of the rectangle.
2. Scatter the random objects throughout the play area to create an obstacle course.
3. Invite players to form partners with a peer that they trust.
4. Explain that this is a game where one player will need to trust their partner to guide them. The guide will need to be very trustworthy and work hard to guide their partner safely.
5. Ask a volunteer from each pair who feels comfortable being blindfolded to play the role of the Computer.
6. Give each Computer a blindfold.
7. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * Programs are written as code. Writing code is called coding.
  * The other partner will play the role of the Coder.
  * Each pair will stand behind the start line.
  * The Computer will wear the blindfold and prepare to cross the obstacle course.
  * When you say, “Go!” each pair will move through the obstacle course to the other side of the rectangle and back.
  * The Coder will give the Computer clear instructions to move through the obstacle course. For example: Step right. Turn left. Stop.
  * The Coder can walk beside the Computer but may not touch the Computer in any way.
  * If the Computer touches an object in the obstacle course, they must return to the start line and begin again.
  * This is not a race, but a challenge to see if each team can work together to make it safely through the obstacle course.
8. Repeat the game allowing the players to change roles.

::: warning Questions
When you were a Coder, what made it easy or challenging to give clear instructions?

How did it feel to know that your partner depended completely on you?

When you were a Computer, what made it easy or challenging to follow instructions?

In real life, what are some times where we depend on instructions or information from others?

What happens if the instructions or information is not clear?

## 2. Stars and Rookies

To give clear and specific instructions; to know that computers depend on clear and specific instructions.

::: warning Rules
Goal: To give clear and specific instructions; to know that computers depend on clear and specific instructions.

Materials: None

No. of Players: 3 or more
:::

> How do you think a computer knows how to do a task? - Computer programs have clear instructions.


### How to Play

1. Form teams of 3-4.
2. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * Each player will take one role: the Star, the Rookie or the Coach. (If there are 4 players, 2 will be Coaches.)
  * The Star stands behind the Rookie so that the Rookie cannot see them. The Coach needs to see both players (see image)
  * The Star will think of 3 movements and make them slowly.
  * The goal is for the Coach to instruct the Rookie to copy exactly what the Star is doing
  * The Rookie does not know the name of any exercise movements, so the Coach must tell them how to make each movement. For example, instead of saying “jumping jack”, the Coach should describe how to move their arms and legs.
  * The Coach cannot demonstrate the actions.
  * The Rookie should not look at the Star.
  * The Star should continue the 3 movements in order until the Rookie does them correctly.
  * When the Rookie does the movements correctly, players can change roles.
3. Call players to change roles so that everyone has a turn in each role.

::: warning Rules
Goal: To instruct teammates to act out a word.

Materials: Game Cards, Flipchart/scrap paper, Markers/pens/pencils

No. of Players: 5 or more
:::

> Can you think of a time when people did not understand you? / How could you have communicated more clearly?

### How to Play

1. Form teams of 5-6 (make sure each team has a strong writer who can write for the team).
2. Give each team a set of Game Cards (face down).
3. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * The first player is the Instructor.
  * The Instructor will take a card. Only the Instructor may see the card.
  * The Instructor will tell the other players how to act out the word on the card. 
  * They will give one instruction at a time.
  * The Instructor cannot say any form of the word. (For example, if the word is “flying”, they cannot say “fly”. They can say, “Spread out your arms and move them up and down”.)
  * The Instructor cannot name any pretend objects. (For example, they cannot say, “Move your wings up and down”. They can say, “Move your arms up and down”.)
  * When the Instructor finishes giving instructions, players can guess the word.
  * If players cannot guess correctly, the Instructor can give new instructions to help them.
  * The player that guesses correctly can choose the next Instructor.
  * Teams should give everyone a chance to be the Instructor.
4. After the game, give paper and markers to each team.
5. Invite each team to choose one of the actions from the game and write step-by-step instructions for it.
6. Explain that a set of steps is called an algorithm.
7. Invite volunteers to read their algorithms for the wider group to follow.

## 4. Secret Handshake

To create algorithms with clear instructions.

::: warning Rules
Goal: To create instructions for a special handshake.

Materials: Flipchart paper, Markers

No. of Players: 4 or more
:::

> Why is it important to give clear instructions? Did you ever create instructions for a computer before?

### How to Play

1. Form teams of 4-6 (make sure each group has a strong writer who can write for the team).
2. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * In some countries, children like to greet their friends with a secret handshake.
  * Each team will create their own secret handshake.
  * Each player will think of one action for the greeting (this can be any action and players do not need to shake hands)
  * The team will decide what order to do the actions in.
  * The team will write this out as a set of steps, called an algorithm 
  (each team only needs to create one copy of the algorithm).
  * The team can follow their algorithm to see if the instructions are correct. They should make sure they are doing what the algorithm says.
  * If the instructions do not work, the team can fix mistakes.
  * After 15 minutes, teams will test their algorithms with the wider group.
3. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * To test their algorithms, teams will read the instructions one line at a time.
  * Their peers will follow the instructions one line at a time.
  * Teams cannot demonstrate their algorithm.
  * If the algorithm is not working, they may give new instructions.
4. The activity ends when all teams have tested their algorithms.

### How to Play

1. Mark a start and end line approximately 10 metres apart.
2. Form teams of 4-6 (make sure each team has a strong writer who can write for the team).
3. Invite one player from each team to volunteer to be the Dragon.
4. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * They are explorers looking for treasure.
  * A dragon guards the treasure. The only way to pass the dragon is to do 4 actions:
    * Offer to shake its hand.
    * Offer the dragon a fish.
    * Spin around 3 times.
    * Say, “We are here to pass the gate.”
  * Nobody knows the correct order of the actions except the dragon.
  * The Dragon from each team will be behind the end line and have a card that
  * The teams must guess the order and go to the Dragon to do the actions.
  * You will give each team a movement to use to move towards the end line 
  (for example, hop on one foot, crawl, move backwards etc.).
  * When they are one arms-length away from the Dragon, they will do the 4 actions.
  * If the order is incorrect, the Dragon will pretend to breathe fire and chase the team back to the start line to tag them.
  * If a player is tagged, they will join the Dragon at the end line.
  * Teams can try many times until they get the correct order.
  * If it is correct, the Dragon will say, “You may pass.”
5. Ask teams who are finished to write the actions in order in 2 ways: (1) a list of steps and (2) a flowchart.
6. If there is time, invite teams who finish early to choose a new Dragon to play again.
7. Ask the new Dragon to secretly change the order of the steps or to use a new Game Card.

:::

> How do you feel when you make a mistake? 􏰂 How can we learn from our mistakes?

### How to Play

1. Form teams of 6 (make sure each group has a strong writer who can write for the team).
2. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * Building an algorithm takes time and many different tries.
  * It is normal to make mistakes.
  * They will practice finding and fixing mistakes.
  * Each team will create a short cheer that the group/class can do when they need a break from a hard task. The cheer should be active.
  * Each team will take up to 10 minutes to write out an algorithm (step-by-step instructions) to teach the cheer to another team.
  * As teams create their algorithms, they can try to follow the instructions themselves to make sure they are clear and correct.
3. When teams finish their algorithms, pair each team with another team.
4. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * Each team will read their algorithm to the other team one line at a time.
  * As they read each line, the other team will follow the instructions.
  * The team will mark the mistakes that they find in the instructions 
  (for example, something that is not correct or not clear enough). The teams will work together to fix them.
5. Give teams 15 minutes to test and fix their algorithms.
6. Gather everyone together.
7. Explain that the group will celebrate what they have done today by doing the cheers as loud as they can. Invite teams to use their algorithms to lead their cheers with the wider group.
