> What are the different ways to share a message in your community? / share information on a computer ?


### How to Play

1. Mark a large play area with a circle in the centre. Place the Game Cards in the circle near the edges.
2. Form teams of 3-6.
3. Ask each team to go to a different place at the edge of the play area. 
    (If you have more than 6 teams, mark 2 separate play areas.)
4. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * For each round, the team will choose a Taker to pick up a card.
  * The Taker needs to touch the corner of the play area with their foot/hand until you say “Go”.
  * When you say “Go” the Taker from each team will go to the centre and take a card.
  * When each team has a card, you will call out a word or phrase. (See the examples below.)
  * The goal of the team is to show the word/phrase through the role on the card:
    * Actors will communicate only with actions.
    * Artists will create a scene and stay still.
    * Musicians will communicate only with sounds.
    * Writers will use their bodies to form letters and words24.
    * eams will have 4 minutes to create their message to share with the group.
5. After each round, mix up the cards and return them to the circle.
6. The game ends at your discretion.

  * The player will bring the card back to the start line without showing it to their team.
  * The player will act out the word on the card for the team to guess.
  * The team will keep the card and the next player will take a turn.
  * Optional: If you think players will have difficulty guessing, explain that the cards have something in common.
5. When the relay is finished, invite each team to look at their cards and find 2 or more things that all of the cards have in common. Explain that these things are patterns because they are repeated in every card.
6. Invite each team to think of 2-3 more words that follow the patterns.
7. Invite teams to volunteer to share their words with the wider group (teams will say the words on the cards and the 2-3 new words).
8. Invite teams to review their nicknames and try again.Invite the rest of the group to guess the patterns.
9. The game ends at your discretion.


::: warning Questions

No. of Players: Any
:::

> What is something that you can learn to do by watching people?

### How to Play

1. Choose a pattern from the examples below or your own. You will use this pattern to decide if objects are accepted for the secret mission.
2. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * Your name is _____________ and you are on a secret mission to save the community.
  * You are looking for objects that you need for the mission.
  * Players can look for objects around the play area that they think will support the mission.
  * When they think of an object, they can bring it to you. If they cannot carry it, they can tell you what it is and you will post it on flipchart paper. (If your play area does not have many objects, players can say items that are not in the play area.)
  * If the object supports the mission, you will accept it. If it does not, you will ask them to try again.
  * You cannot tell them what the mission is, but the objects follow a pattern. They need to pay attention to the objects that are accepted and not accepted to find the pattern.
  * ou cannot accept the same object more than once.
  * Players who think of an accepted object can help other players.
3. The game ends when most players have figured out the pattern.

## 7.Blindfool Fishing

To use charts to make comparisons and find similarities.

::: warning Rules
Goal: To compare chores and show the results on a chart.

Materials: Pens/pencils, Pieces of paper, Basin or large container, Blindfolds, Flipchart paper, Markers

No. of Players: 5 or more
:::

> Did you use a chart to compare something before? What kind of chart did you use?

### How to Play

1. Form teams of 5-6 (make sure each group has a strong writer who can write for the team).
2. Place the basin in the centre of the play area and invite teams to form lines around the basin (approximately 5 metres away).
3. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * This game will help players learn more about their community by looking at similarities.    
  * Each piece of paper is a Fish and the basin is the Pond.
  * Every player will create 2 Fish by writing down 2 of their chores at home, one on each piece of paper.
  * Players will place their papers face-down in the Pond.
4. When all Fish are in the pond, mix the pieces of paper around.
5. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * We can learn about a group of people by taking a random sample.
  * To do this, they will go fishing with their eyes closed.
  * Each player will choose a partner from their team and work in pairs.
  * When you say “Go!”, one player will put on the blindfold, move to the Pond and collect 4 Fish.
  * Their partner will be their guide.
  * When they return, it is the next pair’s turn.
  * Players who do not wish to wear the blindfold can close their eyes.
6. Play the game.
7. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * Each team now has 10-12 Fish with different chores.
  * The goal is to find at least 3 characteristics that all or most of the chores have in common.
  * To do this, teams will think of characteristics that might be common to all of the chores and create a Tally Chart (or Frequency Table) to compare how common each characteristic is (see examples below).
  * If most or all of the chores have a characteristic, it is a similarity.
  * We have a pattern when it is common to all of the chores. When we try to learn about a group of people, we cannot always find patterns that fit 100% of the time. There are often exceptions.
8. Give teams at least 10-15 minutes for this activity.
9. As teams work, move around and ask prompting questions if they have difficulty finding similarities or creating a chart.
10. Invite volunteers to share their findings with the wider group.

::: warning Questions

> What are some different charts or graphs that you can use to compare something?

### How to Play

1. Form teams of 4-6.
2. Ask teams to remember who their team members are (or give armbands to each team).
3. Give each player 2 pieces of paper.
4. xplain and demonstrate that:
  * This game is about a community event/festival
  * Each player will write down 2 safe and positive things that they do on this event – one on each piece of paper.
5. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * They will use one another’s papers to learn about their community.
  * When you say “Go” players will hold on to their pieces of paper and move around the play area.
  * The goal of is to get pieces of paper for their team by tagging players from the other teams gently.
  * Only complete pieces of paper (not ripped or broken) will count towards their total.
  * If a player is tagged, the 2 players will shake hands (or give a high-5). Then the tagged player will give the other player one piece of paper. They can give their own piece of paper or one that they collected.
  * The 2 players continue to play and cannot tag one another immediately after this.
6. After 5-8 minutes of play, invite teams to count their pieces of paper.
7. Invite teams with more papers to give some to teams with less so that every team has at least.
8. Give flipchart paper and markers to each team.
9. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * Teams will look at the activities on the pieces of paper and create a conclusion of what children do at the event
  * They can create a conclusion by looking for similarities – things that the activities have in common.
  * To do this, teams will think of characteristics that might be common to all of the activities and create a Tally Chart (or Frequency Table) to compare how common each characteristic is (see examples below).
  * If most or all of the activities have that characteristic, it is a similarity. These similarities tell them the types of things that children usually do at this event.
  * We have a pattern when it is common to all of the activities. When we try to learn about a group of people, we cannot always find patterns that fit 100% of the time. There are often exceptions.
  * Teams will have 10-15 minutes for this.
10. Invite volunteers to share their findings with the wider group.

## 9. Welcome Book

To find patterns in the community.

::: warning Rules
Goal: To collect items and find patterns among them.

Materials: Flipchart paper (or chalkboard), Markers (or chalk) 􏰂 A4 paper, Pens/pencils

No. of Players: 6 or more
:::

> Do you know anyone from another community or country?

### How to Play

1. Ask: If a new child moves into your community, what will they need to learn about your community?
2. Write the answers on flipchart paper and group similar ideas into general topics.    
3. Form circles in teams of 6.
4. Give each team 3 sheets of A4 paper and pens/pencils.
  * This game is about a community event/festival
  * Each player will write down 2 safe and positive things that they do on this event – one on each piece of paper.
5. Explain and demonstrate that:
6. Invite each team to choose a topic from step 2.
7. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * Together, players will create a guidebook for children who are new to their community.
  * They have broken their task into different parts – each team will work one topic.
  * They will form pairs with a teammate who is beside them in the circle.
  * Each pair will take one A4 sheet.
  * At the top of the page, the pair will write down one question a new child would ask about the topic. The question should be something that the team can answer. For example, “What are the best snacks?” “Where should I buy food?”
  * When you say “Go!” each pair will write down their own answers to the question at the bottom of the page.
  * Players will also write down 2-3 reasons why they chose that answer. For example, if they said Mrs. Alia’s shop was the best place to buy food, the reasons could be: “cheap”, “open on weekends” and “safe”.
  * When you say “Pass!” players will fold the bottom of their sheet up just enough to cover their answers (see diagram) and pass it to the pair on their right (who is on the same team).
  * When you say “Go!” each pair will answer the new question and write their answers and reasons above the edge of the sheet.
  * When you say “Stop!” players will fold it up just enough to cover their answers and pass it to the pair on their right (who is on the same team).
  * You will say “Go” and “Stop” for pairs to answer the new question and pass the sheet to the pair on their right.
  * Each pair will then have their own question sheet.
7. Invite pairs to look at the answers. Remind players to check the back of their sheets to make sure they do not miss any answers.
8. Ask: Are all of the answers the same?
9. Explain and demonstrate that:
  * To get a general idea of what their community is like, they can look for patterns among the answers.
  * Each answer has 2-3 reasons.
  * When you say “Go!” pairs will look at what the reasons on their sheet have in common and write them down. For example, did everyone say their shop or market stand was the best because it was cheap?
  * When you say “Share!” players will share their findings with the team.
10. Collect the notes and explain that they will use them in the next activity

::: warning Questions
Did your team members always have the same ideas? Why or why not?
